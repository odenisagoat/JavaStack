EECS 1022 Diary Project

### Name of the Team : JavaStack
### Title of the Project : DailyDiary

### Project Description: 

A digital diary that allows users to keep track of their written thoughts every day on their smartphone. Users can keep their entries private by locking the diary. They can create their own unlock pattern or a lock which requires a PIN code or a password. Once unlocked, a diary page is displayed where they can start typing in their thoughts, and create and delete new diary pages. They can upload photos/ videos and sort pages into different colored tags. The app has a Weather widget to display the day’s weather, and all users’ data can be exported to PDF.
